# Week 1 (28th Jan)
This week is summed up by:
* Househunting woes
* Module intros

The module introductions were interesting! I'm not yet sure how I'll manage my time for them all, but I've started filling out my calendar. Maybe I should setup a workflow, wherein every Monday morning I spend 30 minutes planning out my Google Calendar for the rest of the week, using the task list on the right-hand side as reference for the things I should allocate.

I had a degree of anxiety about looking at the results for last year and ended up putting it off. **This was needless** as delaying ny awarebess if the results would do nothing to change them. My initial rationale was that my mood would be thrown off if I didn't do well. The habit of losing faith in my future self will keep counteracting my independence, so I will try to count more on the fact that I can handle things as they come along and thus can do them immediately.

I have not achieved any of my previous goals due to losing track of time. I'll try and do those through this week, at least as far as the Twitter update and assertiveness pages. I'll grab the book this evening (Mon 4th Feb)

# Week 2 (4th Feb) (220 words)
This week, I felt over-stressed. The main cause may have been my PASS session. I created the choice of an icebreaker session, or a general session, and it wasn't set in stone. In the end, I handled it by staying calm and adapting - the attendance started low, so I chose the latter option. It went well: nothing special, but an appropriate warm-up to the module. We discussed ideas between each other, which hopefully helped those stuck for ideas.

Next time, I could improve my criticism toward my team. I raised my concerns in the PO meeting, but I did not offer solutions, and had not conveyed my concerns consistently to the team beforehand. I targeted an artist as well, which felt scummy to do in front of the PO. It felt like I made a 'dad, look at this' scenario. However, as he raised the question 'is everyone clear on everything', bringing it up was the right thing. I can improve this next time by **bringing these concerns up earlier, as they appear**.

Furthermore, I could handle more of the planning myself. However, I feel that would be a nonassertive approach. It is not my responsibility to overlook the entire game, but I could **take initiative** by organising tasks and ensuring each one is **delegated** to the right person.

Assertiveness - interesting fact: Nonassertion, assertion and aggression can be distinguished by which party(s) have their needs met.

# Week 3 (11th Feb)
This week I questioned the team dynamic. On Friday, a team member told another to fuck off and he wasn't working on the game anymore. This team member is one who I felt most strongly about his impatience, but in retrospect I didn't see the real problem. As always, I maintain a professional attitude and always work like I know no difference between friendly and toxic.

This team member was difficult to talk with, and since he vanished, the other team members are working better together. The difficulty of dealing with him probably scaled up with the other team members, who are quiet and reasonable, and I regret not condemning his approach sooner. I felt I was weak to his strong personality.

I try to remain open-minded and this is positive. However, I could have noticed that even if I can work with a proposed approach, many others can't and will not be explicit about it. I will be more sensitive to my feelings of discomfort from now on, as others may share them. This means more assertiveness and self-confidence.

On the bright side, this was my most social week in a long time. So many events!

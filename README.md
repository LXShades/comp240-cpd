# Week 1 (28th Jan)
This week is summed up by:
* Househunting woes
* Module intros

The module introductions were interesting! I'm not yet sure how I'll manage my time for them all, but I've started filling out my calendar. Maybe I should setup a workflow, wherein every Monday morning I spend 30 minutes planning out my Google Calendar for the rest of the week, using the task list on the right-hand side as reference for the things I should allocate.

I had a degree of anxiety about looking at the results for last year and ended up putting it off. **This was needless** as delaying ny awarebess if the results would do nothing to change them. My initial rationale was that my mood would be thrown off if I didn't do well. The habit of losing faith in my future self will keep counteracting my independence, so I will try to count more on the fact that I can handle things as they come along and thus can do them immediately.

I have not achieved any of my previous goals due to losing track of time. I'll try and do those through this week, at least as far as the Twitter update and assertiveness pages. I'll grab the book this evening (Mon 4th Feb)

# Week 2 (4th Feb) (220 words)
This week, I felt over-stressed. The main cause may have been my PASS session. I created the choice of an icebreaker session, or a general session, and it wasn't set in stone. In the end, I handled it by staying calm and adapting - the attendance started low, so I chose the latter option. It went well: nothing special, but an appropriate warm-up to the module. We discussed ideas between each other, which hopefully helped those stuck for ideas.

Next time, I could improve my criticism toward my team. I raised my concerns in the PO meeting, but I did not offer solutions, and had not conveyed my concerns consistently to the team beforehand. I targeted an artist as well, which felt scummy to do in front of the PO. It felt like I made a 'dad, look at this' scenario. However, as he raised the question 'is everyone clear on everything', bringing it up was the right thing. I can improve this next time by **bringing these concerns up earlier, as they appear**.

Furthermore, I could handle more of the planning myself. However, I feel that would be a nonassertive approach. It is not my responsibility to overlook the entire game, but I could **take initiative** by organising tasks and ensuring each one is **delegated** to the right person.

Assertiveness - interesting fact: Nonassertion, assertion and aggression can be distinguished by which party(s) have their needs met.

# Week 3 (11th Feb)
This week I questioned the team dynamic. On Friday, a team member told another to fuck off and he wasn't working on the game anymore. This team member is one who I felt most strongly about his impatience, but in retrospect I didn't see the real problem. As always, I maintain a professional attitude and always work like I know no difference between friendly and toxic.

This team member was difficult to talk with, and since he vanished, the other team members are working better together. The difficulty of dealing with him probably scaled up with the other team members, who are quiet and reasonable, and I regret not condemning his approach sooner. I felt I was weak to his strong personality.

I treid to remain open-minded. However, I could have instead noticed that even if I can work with a dominating approach, many others can't, and won't express it. I will be more sensitive to my feelings of discomfort from now on, as others may share them. This means more assertiveness and self-confidence.

On the bright side, this was my most social week in a long time. So many events!

# Week 4 (18th Feb)
This week had our first PO meeting after the FART incident, AKA the 'Fuck off, ARTist'. Anticipating a more extensive discussion, what we instead had was priase of the game and being told to continue with this. In spite of the drama, the game is developing strongly on the artistic side and the artists are cooperating more.

In situations like this, sometimes I feel that our team morale is neglected.  We have been told to carry on as normal - in terms of confronting the situation, we're not really any further. It is a shame, but at this stage it is hard to anticipate how we could work together now. The ball is in the aggressor's court, and we've had no apology for the behaviour. We did have an apology for 'dipping on us' mind, but it was followed by disappearance when he was told that a task he was suggesting was already being taken by another artist.

It's frustrating, and further reason to take an assertive stance - which is, perhaps, to take no responsibility. As far as confrontation is concerned, confronting this kind of personality has less benefit than confronting those who e.g. don't attend regularly.

# Week 5 (25th Feb)
PASS session decision. I had a difficult time with this one. In trying to come across as less of a try-hard, I made the PASS sessions much more relaxed and less structured for this term. However, attendance this week was 3 and dropped to 1 in the last quarter-hour.

I proposed moving back to the studio. Overall, some were lukewarm about this suggestion. Still, I disagree, and will discuss it with the staff on Monday. Much like the team situation, this was one of those cases where I realised there was a problem but felt an urge to step back when others said it's fine. This time, however, I will assess it proactively, as the attendance blatently depicts a failure to attract interest.

I know I could significantly improve the sessions, but I feel defeated by the work I need to do. The distraction of work is hindering my personal development and I'm frustrated. Running PASS sessions already makes me nervous. Perhaps, if I wasn't anxious, I would

* Run peer reviews?
* Avoid treating it as PASS and simply state solutions, as my sessions are perhaps too slow for everyone.

Overall, I feel inadequate for this role right now.

# Week 6 (4th March)
This week is summed up by:
* Working on the trailer
* Trying to get a house
* PASS session attendance @ 3 people...

I'll focus on the trailer. In an example of bad time management, I successfully stayed up until 6am, re-recording footage of the frog game. I felt quite strongly about the frame rate and colour scheme. In retrospect, this added value to the trailer, but may not have been worth the lack of energy the next day.

On the brighter side, I have secured a house for next year - an issue which was affecting my work in other areas. In fact, I must improve my division of focus between tasks. I will try and pre-schedule more regularly on Google Calendar and ensure every task makes it in.

# Week 7 (11th March)
This week's Show and Tell was especially positive. Me and Charlie presented the first game of all. During practice, I was very fearful that I would forget my lines. However, continually reinforcing them with practice did the trick. Also, even with hundreds of eyes on me, I didn't feel very nervous, which was a big benefit. I am numbed to the judging eyes.

My PO feedback has been lower lately, as I haven't been delivering consistent programming work on the game. I've had trouble balancing my time commitments. Previously, they were skewed heavily in favour of the game, but with deadlines approaching, my assignments have taken precedence. From hereon I'll improve my consistency and inform the team in advance of when I'm available (as unfair as it feels, as few others do the same).

I have been stressed about the many smaller tasks that need doing, such as course rep responsibilities and PASS leader duties. I will focus this week on improved time management. Currently, there are dormant tasks on my task list. I will remove these and fill the list with essential tasks, including talking to staff about the PASS session issue, etc.

# Week 8 (18th March)
* PASS sessions were still faltering
* Research Journal - A lot of effort for 10%?
* Finishing MUD evaluation in the library and sacrificing personl time for work

# Week 9 (25th March)
I can't think of many memorable things this week! What went wrong? Actually, perhaps the main issue was being distracted by a personal issue or two - this took away my focus but is beyond the scope of my professional development. I noticed - and received team feedback - that I have acted negatively around the game. Ultimately I can't shake the thought that the game could be better, and that the regular low team attendance is impacting it. However, if I understand that a positive attitude can, at this stage, only improve the game, then I can ensure that I remain positive.

"Positive" is a vague term, so to test myself I will count the number of times I've included something like a negative 'but' in my sentences, and when addressing issues, try to take a more proactive approach. Try to replace things like 'it could be better if...' with 'let's be even better by...'.

What went well this week? Course rep feedback! Doing this as a survey worked much better for us computing students. I'll continue to do this in the future when collecting feedback.

# Week 10 (1st April)
April Fools!

I cannot remember what happened this week due to somehow forgetting to fill it in. I expect there was a lot of pain and suffering. Course rep nomination stuff challenged my proactivity. A deadline was given, but no-one was prepared to follow the system given to us. I feel it was impractical to request that we find two people who would nominate us before we begin voting. With two course reps total, that would mean six people would need to take action before voting even starts; that's well over half of the people who regularly attend. I requested an extension to the deadline.

# Week 11 (8th April)
*And now for something completely different!*

I hosted a party this weekend! Interpersonal domain time! I'll keep it short.

What went well:
* I asked folks to bring games, snacks, etc. We had much food!
* The others made the party

What didn't go well:
* In the inviting stages, I didn't ask for a contribution, so paid for the pizza ingredients
* It took me a while to gain momentum and invite everyone

Several of my problems were in the dispositional domain rather than the interpersonal domain. This included delaying invitations and asking for a contribution.

The following factors led me to delay it:
* Uncertainty of how to ask
* Uncertainty of Abi's position on who to invite, what time, etc

The key word is uncertainty. As an introvert, I don't get energised by interacting with people. I can verify a lot more and become less certain by asking people early on. When I don't know, I can take an initial assumption.

Next time, I will:
* Ascertain the **time**, **people to invite** and **food to have** at least 5 days before the day.
* Ascertain the **ingredients to buy** for the food and **ask for a contribution while inviting**.

This way I will feel happier and in control about my spending on ingredients.

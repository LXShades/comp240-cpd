# Week 1 (28th Jan)
This week is summed up by:
* Househunting woes
* Module intros

The module introductions were interesting! I'm not yet sure how I'll manage my time for them all, but I've started filling out my calendar. Maybe I should setup a workflow, wherein every Monday morning I spend 30 minutes planning out my Google Calendar for the rest of the week, using the task list on the right-hand side as reference for the things I should allocate.

I had a degree of anxiety about looking at the results for last year and ended up putting it off. **This was needless** as delaying ny awarebess if the results would do nothing to change them. My initial rationale was that my mood would be thrown off if I didn't do well. The habit of losing faith in my future self will keep counteracting my independence, so I will try to count more on the fact that I can handle things as they come along and thus can do them immediately.

I have not achieved any of my previous goals due to losing track of time. I'll try and do those through this week, at least as far as the Twitter update and assertiveness pages. I'll grab the book this evening (Mon 4th Feb)
